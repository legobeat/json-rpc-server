# Overview

The Shardeum JSON-RPC Server enables developers to interact with the Shardeum blockchain network. It allows dapps to post request, retrieve information, and other related operations, using JSON-RPC over HTTP. Additionally, the Shardeum JSON-RPC Server comes with an added REST API for debugging and monitoring purposes.

For running existing dapps on Shardeum, refer to EVM [JSON-RPC API](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/)

## Docker setup

For developers deploying to production environments, simply use `docker compose` command.

env `NO_OF_RPC_SERVERS` creates replicas of rpc servers using pm2. default is 1. Default port is 8080, port for each replicas will increment by 1 on default port. i.e 8081, 8082, 8083, etc.

### Start json-rpc-server

```shell
# Run services in detach mode
docker compose up -d
```

### Check the logs

```shell
docker compose logs -f
```

### Clean the setup

```shell
docker compose down
```

## Developer Environment Setup

For end users, such as exchanges and large decentralized applications (dApps), seeking to deploy their own RPC server, it is recommended to run the Shardeum JSON-RPC server using Docker. It ensures all dependencies are installed and the server is running in a consistent environment. For developers who want to contribute to this project, running the server from source is recommended. You can use `npm` for installing the server locally.

### Requirements

If you are using `Docker`, in order to run the Shardeum JSON-RPC server, you must have the [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) daemon installed.

### Installing project source code

Letâ€™s install the project source code, switch to `dev` branch and follow the below instructions:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shardeum/json-rpc-server.git
cd shardeum-json-rpc
git switch dev
```

If you are building using `Docker`, run the below command:

```bash
make build
```

This command will build Docker images for the service.

If you are building using `NPM`, run the below command, it will install all the required dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## Starting JSON-RPC Server

If you are building using `Docker`, you can start the JSON-RPC server by running the following command:

```bash
make run
```

This will start a container running the `shardeum-json-rpc` server image, available on port `8080`. The servers configuration fields can be viewed and edited in the `src/config.ts` file. Additionally, you can manage the server's access control lists by editing the `whitelist.json`, `blacklist.json` and `spammerlist.json`.

But if you are using NPM, use the below command to run the server:

```bash
npm run start
```

If you want to modify the chainId or the port number, go to `src/config.ts` file:

```bash
chainId: 8082
port: 8080
```

The RPC URL for using Metamask with Remix IDE and for running scripts is <http://localhost:port> (default: <http://localhost:8080>)

If you are contributing to this project, use Shardeum server to create the network from within the [validator repo](https://gitlab.com/shardus/archive/archive-server). You can find more details [here](https://github.com/shardeum/shardeum)

## Running Tests

To set up the Shardeum network locally for testing purposes, follow these steps:

1. **Modify the Script**

Before running the `setup_shardeum_network.sh` script, you need to update the `REPO_URL` on line 11 to point to the correct repository URL. Open the script in a text editor and modify the following line:

```bash
REPO_URL="/path/to/your/local/shardeum"
```

2. **Run the Script**

```bash
./setup_shardeum_network.sh
```

This script automates the setup and initialization of the Shardeum network for local testing. It ensures Node Version Manager (nvm) and Node.js are properly configured, sets up the necessary repository paths, and creates symbolic links. The script then installs project dependencies, including Node.js and Rust, and builds the project. It applies necessary patches, starts the Shardus network with 10 nodes, and waits for the network to initialize. Finally, it starts the JSON-RPC server and runs the test suite, ensuring the environment is ready for development and testing purposes.

### Additional Information

For detailed information about the tests, check the test files located in `src/__tests__`. Each test file contains specific tests for different parts of the JSON-RPC server.

## Cleanup

If you are using `Docker`, you can stop the server by running:

```bash
make stop
```

Additionally, you can remove the docker images by running:

```bash
make clean
```

This will remove all docker images created by the server during the build process.

## DEBUG Endpoints

These api are protected preventing general public to wiping out debug data to authenticate use `/authenticate/:passphrase`. `passphrase` is set in `config.ts` config file or within the system env variable.

GET `/log/api-stats` this endpint emit the rpc interface call counts and avg tps along with a few a other information. This endpoint support query by time range. i.e `/log/api-stats?start={x}&end={x}`. The parameter value can be either `yyyy-mm-dd` or unix epoch in millisecond. (NOTE standard unix epoch is in seconds which does not work, it has to be in millisecond accuracy). Not setting any timestamp parameter will returns paginated json of all the entry in db.

GET `/log/txs` this endpoint return the txs it has been made through rpc server. This endpoint support dynmaic pagination. i.e `/log/txs?max=30&page=9`.
Default values are `1000` for `max` and `0` for page.

GET `/log/status` this endpint return status of logging such as date of recording start and whether or not recording is enabled.

GET `/log/startTxCapture` this endpoint set the config value to true which control whether to capture incoming txs and store in database.

GET `/log/stopRPCCapture` this endpoint set the config value to false which control whether to capture incoming rpc interface call stat and store in database

GET `/log/startRPCCapture` this endpoint set the config value to true which control whether to capture rpc interface call stat and store in database.

GET `/log/stopTxCapture` this endpoint set the config value to false which control whether to capture incoming txs and store in database

GET `/cleanStatTable` this endpoint trigger purging of table that store interface stats

GET `/cleanTxTable` this endpoint trigger purging of table that store transaction logging
